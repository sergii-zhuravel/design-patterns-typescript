_Powered with Gatsby_

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into  site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd design-patterns-typescript/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*
    
    Open the the `app` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
